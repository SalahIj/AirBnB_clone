Airbnb Console Clone with Python
Overview
Welcome to the Airbnb Console Clone project! This project aims to replicate the basic functionality of the Airbnb platform through a console-based application. The project is developed by Zakaria Grari and Ijbar Salah Eddine.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python



## Project Description

This is an AirBnB clone project, implementing a simplified version of the AirBnB platform. It includes a custom command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the system, create and manage various entities, and perform CRUD operations.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a Python script named 'console.py' that provides a command-line interface for managing the AirBnB clone. It allows users to interact with the system using a set of commands to manipulate entities such as User, Place, State, City, Amenity, and Review.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the following command in your terminal:

""" bash """
./console.py
